Requirements  
=
Python---3.8  
PyTorch---1.12  
scanpy---1.9.2  
It should be noted that the results obtained may vary slightly depending on the version used.  

Usage  
=
To obtain the results, simply run the "main.py" file as the dataset is in h5 format. The final output reports the clustering performance ( NMI, ARI, ACC and AMI ). By replacing "filename", you can obtain clustering metrics for different datasets.
